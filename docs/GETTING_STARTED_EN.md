# Memory Palace Quick Start

This guide helps you set up the Memory Palace local development environment or Docker deployment in 5 minutes.

> **Memory Palace** is a long-term memory system designed for AI Agents. It provides 9 tools via the [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) protocol, enabling persistent memory capabilities for clients such as Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode. If you are integrating an IDE host such as `Cursor / Windsurf / VSCode-host / Antigravity`, start with `docs/skills/IDE_HOSTS_EN.md`.

> 📌 This diagram is only to help you quickly remember the sequence.
>
> The actual commands in the text take precedence:
>
> - Backend defaults to `uvicorn` running at `127.0.0.1:8000`
> - Frontend dev server defaults to `5173`
> - Docker default entries are `http://127.0.0.1:3000` (Dashboard) and `http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse` (SSE)

## 3. Local Development (Recommended First Path)

### Step 1: Prepare Configuration Files

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

> The file copied here is the **more conservative `.env.example` minimal template**. It is sufficient to complete the local startup, but **does not mean Profile B has been applied**.
>
> If you want to use the default values defined in the repository for Profile B (e.g., local hash Embedding), please prioritize using the Profile scripts below; if you continue to manually modify `.env.example`, that's fine too—just understand it as "supplementing configuration as needed from a minimal template."

> **Important**: After copying, please check `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and change the path to your actual path. Absolute paths are highly recommended for shared environments or near-production scenarios. For example:
>
> ```
> DATABASE_URL=sqlite+aiosqlite:////absolute/path/to/memory_palace/demo.db
> ```

You can also use the Profile script to quickly generate an `.env` with default configurations:

```bash
# macOS / Linux —— Parameters: Platform Profile [Target File]
# Current script accepted template values are macos|windows|docker; Linux local also uses the macos template.
bash scripts/apply_profile.sh macos b

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\apply_profile.ps1 -Platform windows -Profile b
```

> The `apply_profile` script copies `.env.example` to `.env` (or your specified target file) and then appends the override configuration for the corresponding Profile. On macOS, it also automatically detects and fills in `DATABASE_URL`.
>
> `apply_profile.sh/.ps1` currently deduplicates environment keys after generation; however, running it again in the target environment is still recommended for native Windows / native `pwsh`.
>
> Note: **The profile-b `.env` generated locally for macOS / Windows will not automatically fill in `MCP_API_KEY`**. If you are about to open the Dashboard, or directly call `/browse` / `/review` / `/maintenance`, `/sse`, or `/messages`, please supplement `MCP_API_KEY` yourself, or set `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true` for local loopback debugging only. Only the `docker` platform profile script will automatically generate a local key if the key is empty.

#### Key Configuration Items

The following are the most commonly used configuration items in `.env` (for more items, please see the comments in `.env.example`):

| Config Item | Description | Template Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLite database path (**Absolute path recommended**) | `sqlite+aiosqlite:////absolute/path/to/memory_palace/demo.db` |
| `SEARCH_DEFAULT_MODE` | Search mode: `keyword` / `semantic` / `hybrid` | `keyword` |
| `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_BACKEND` | Embedding backend: `none` / `hash` / `router` / `api` / `openai` | `none` |
| `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model name | `your-embedding-model-id` |
| `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_ENABLED` | Whether to enable Reranker | `false` |
| `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_API_BASE` | Reranker API address | Empty |
| `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_API_KEY` | Reranker API key | Empty |
| `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_MODEL` | Reranker model name | `your-reranker-model-id` |
| `INTENT_LLM_ENABLED` | Experimental intent LLM toggle | `false` |
| `RETRIEVAL_MMR_ENABLED` | Deduplication / diversity re-ranking under hybrid search | `false` |
| `RETRIEVAL_SQLITE_VEC_ENABLED` | sqlite-vec rollout toggle | `false` |
| `MCP_API_KEY` | Authentication key for HTTP/SSE interfaces | Empty (see Auth section below) |
| `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL` | Allow access without Key during local debugging (only for loopback requests) | `false` |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | List of allowed origins for cross-domain access (leave empty for local default) | Empty |
| `VALID_DOMAINS` | Allowed writable memory URI domains (`system://` is built-in read-only) | `core,writer,game,notes` |

> Profile B uses local hash Embedding by default and does not enable Reranker; it remains the **default starting profile**.
>
> If you have prepared model services, **it is highly recommended to upgrade to Profile C as soon as possible**: it requires you to fill in the Embedding / Reranker chain in `.env`; if you also want to enable LLM-assisted write guard / gist / intent routing, continue filling in `WRITE_GUARD_LLM_*`, `COMPACT_GIST_LLM_*`, and optional `INTENT_LLM_*`. See [DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES_EN.md](DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES_EN.md) for details.
>
> The table above shows template example values from `.env.example`; if certain retrieval environment variables are completely missing at runtime, the backend will use its own fallback values (e.g., `hash` / `hash-v1` / `64`).
>
> Configuration semantics: `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_BACKEND` only affects Embedding. Reranker does not have a `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_BACKEND` toggle; it prioritizes reading `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_*`, falling back to `ROUTER_*` (and finally to `OPENAI_*` base/key) if missing.
>
> More advanced options (such as `INTENT_LLM_*`, `RETRIEVAL_MMR_*`, `RETRIEVAL_SQLITE_VEC_*`, `CORS_ALLOW_*`, runtime observability/sleep consolidation toggles) are documented in `.env.example` and default to conservative values, not affecting the minimal startup path.
>
> Recommended defaults (usually fine to copy):
> - `INTENT_LLM_ENABLED=false`: Use built-in keyword rules first to reduce external dependencies.
> - `RETRIEVAL_MMR_ENABLED=false`: Check raw hybrid results first, only enable if "first few results are too similar."
> - `RETRIEVAL_SQLITE_VEC_ENABLED=false`: Keep the legacy path for normal deployments.
> - `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=`: Leave empty for local dev; specify domains only when opening to browser cross-domain access.
>
> The model names above are just placeholder examples, not hard project dependencies. Memory Palace is not bound to a specific provider or model family; please change them to actual available embedding / reranker / chat model IDs from your own OpenAI-compatible services.
>
> If you are about to open the Dashboard locally, or directly use `curl` to call `/browse` / `/review` / `/maintenance`, it is suggested to add one of the following auth configurations to `.env`:
>
> - `MCP_API_KEY=change-this-local-key`
> - `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true` (Only recommended for loopback debugging on your own machine)

### Step 2: Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
# .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

Expected output:

```
Memory API starting...
SQLite database initialized.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

> The backend completes initialization via the `lifespan` context manager in `main.py`, including SQLite database creation and starting runtime states (Write Lane, Index Worker).
>
> The `uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 ...` command above is the recommended **local development** form.
>
> If you instead run `python main.py`, the current default is `0.0.0.0:8000`. That is more suitable for LAN / remote direct access, but it also means the service listens on external interfaces. Before using that path, make sure your `MCP_API_KEY`, firewall rules, reverse proxy, or equivalent network-side protections are already in place.

### Step 3: Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Frontend i18n dependencies are already included in `frontend/package.json` and `frontend/package-lock.json`. A normal `npm install` is sufficient; you don't need to install `i18next`, `react-i18next`, or `i18next-browser-languagedetector` separately.

Expected output:

```
VITE v7.x.x  ready in xxx ms
➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
```

Open your browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5173` to see the Memory Palace Dashboard.

If you wish to view the Dashboard buttons, fields, and typical operation flows page by page, please see:

- `docs/DASHBOARD_GUIDE_EN.md`

> If you see `Set API key` in the top right corner when starting manually, this is normal: the page is open, but protected interfaces like `/browse/*`, `/review/*`, and `/maintenance/*` are not yet authorized. Clicking this button now opens the **first-run setup assistant**, which can either save the Dashboard key in the current browser or, when you are running against a non-Docker local checkout, write the common runtime fields into `.env`. The assistant also has its own language toggle in the upper right corner, so you do not need to close it first just to switch to Chinese. Section 5 will explain local validation.

> If you configured `MCP_API_KEY`, click `Set API key` in the top right and enter the same key in the assistant. If you only want the Dashboard to authenticate first, prefer the browser-only save path.
> If you enabled `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true`, direct requests from the local loopback address can access these protected data interfaces.

> The assistant does not pretend that Docker env / proxy changes are hot-reloaded. If you change embedding / reranker / write-guard / intent settings, you still need to restart the affected `backend` / `sse` services afterwards. For Docker, continue using the profile scripts and container restart path.

> The frontend defaults to English; if you prefer Chinese, click the language button in the top right to switch, and the browser will remember your choice.

> The frontend dev server proxies `/api` paths to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` via the configuration in `vite.config.js`, so no manual CORS configuration is needed between the front and back ends.

## 4. Docker One-Click Deployment

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash scripts/docker_one_click.sh --profile b

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\docker_one_click.ps1 -Profile b

# If you need to inject the runtime API address/key from the current process into the Docker env file for this run (e.g., profile c/d)
# The injection toggle must be explicitly enabled (default is off):
bash scripts/docker_one_click.sh --profile c --allow-runtime-env-injection
# or
.\scripts\docker_one_click.ps1 -Profile c -AllowRuntimeEnvInjection
```

> If you enable this kind of local joint debugging injection under `profile c/d`, the script will switch this run to an explicit API mode and additionally force `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_BACKEND=api`. When `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_API_*` / `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_API_*` are not explicitly provided, it will prioritize reusing `ROUTER_API_BASE/ROUTER_API_KEY` from the current process as a fallback; if you also set `INTENT_LLM_*`, this chain will also be injected. This mode is more suitable for local troubleshooting and is not equivalent to verifying the final release `router` template. The current gate-aligned local-debug command is `--runtime-env-mode none --allow-runtime-env-injection --runtime-env-file <your local .env>`; release verification must go back to `--runtime-env-mode none` without injection.

> `docker_one_click.sh/.ps1` defaults to generating an independent temporary Docker env file for **each run**, passed to `docker compose` via `MEMORY_PALACE_DOCKER_ENV_FILE`; it only reuses a specific file if that environment variable is explicitly set, rather than sharing a fixed `.env.docker`.
>
> Concurrent deployments under the same checkout will be serialized by a deployment lock; if another one-click deployment is already executing, subsequent processes will exit immediately with a prompt to retry later.
>
> If `MCP_API_KEY` in the Docker env file is empty, `apply_profile.*` will automatically generate a local key. The Docker frontend will automatically include this key in its proxy layer, so **when starting via the recommended one-click script path**, protected requests usually already work; however, the page may still keep showing `Set API key`, because the browser page itself does not know the proxy-held key. Treat that as expected unless protected data also starts failing with `401` or empty states. Even then, the first-run setup assistant stays in guidance mode for Docker instead of pretending it can persist container env changes.
>
> Currently, Docker Compose also waits for **both backend and SSE `/health` checks** to pass before considering the frontend ready. This means that when the container first shows `running`, the page might take a few more seconds to become truly available, which is normal.
>
> Docker also persists two types of runtime data by default: `memory_palace_data` for the database (internal container path `/app/data`) and `memory_palace_snapshots` for Review snapshots (internal container path `/app/snapshots`). If you execute `docker compose down -v` or manually delete these two volumes, these parts will be cleared together.
>
> **C/D Local Joint Debugging Suggestions**:
>
> - If your local machine's `router` hasn't connected embedding / reranker / llm yet, you can first directly configure `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_*`, `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_*`, `WRITE_GUARD_LLM_*` / `COMPACT_GIST_LLM_*` separately.
> - This makes it easier to determine which specific chain is unreachable, avoiding misjudging "one model not configured correctly" as the entire system being down.
> - Whether you finally adopt the `router` solution or direct configuration for `RETRIEVAL_EMBEDDING_*` / `RETRIEVAL_RERANKER_*`, it is recommended to run the startup and health checks again according to the **final actual deployment configuration**.

> The script automatically performs the following steps:
>
> 1. Calls the Profile script to generate the Docker env file for this run (defaults to a temporary file; reuses the specified path if `MEMORY_PALACE_DOCKER_ENV_FILE` is set).
> 2. Defaults to not reading current process environment variables to override template strategy keys (avoiding implicit profile changes); injects API address/key/model fields only when the injection toggle is explicitly enabled.
> 3. Detects port conflicts and automatically finds available ports.
> 4. Parses and injects Docker persistent volumes: database defaults to `memory_palace_data`, Review snapshots default to `memory_palace_snapshots`.
> 5. Locks concurrent deployments for the same checkout to avoid multiple `docker_one_click` instances overwriting each other.
> 6. Builds and starts containers via `docker compose`.

Default access addresses:

| Service | Address |
|---|---|
| Frontend | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Backend API | `http://localhost:18000` |
| SSE | `http://localhost:3000/sse` |
| Health Check | `http://localhost:18000/health` |
| API Docs (Swagger) | `http://localhost:18000/docs` |

> **Port Mapping Explanation** (from `docker-compose.yml`):
>
> - The frontend container internally runs on port `8080`, mapped externally to `3000` (can be overridden by the `MEMORY_PALACE_FRONTEND_PORT` environment variable).
> - The backend container internally runs on port `8000`, mapped externally to `18000` (can be overridden by the `MEMORY_PALACE_BACKEND_PORT` environment variable).
> - Docker by default persists the database volume (`/app/data`) and review snapshot volume (`/app/snapshots`).

Stop services:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=<compose project printed in console> docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down --remove-orphans
```

> The `down --remove-orphans` command above will not delete data volumes; the database and review snapshots will only be cleared if you explicitly use `docker compose ... down -v` or manually delete the corresponding volumes.

> If you need to verify Windows paths, it is recommended to run startup and smoke tests directly in the target Windows environment.

### 4.1 Backup Current Database

Before performing batch tests, migration verification, or wide-range configuration switching, it is recommended to make a consistent SQLite backup:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
bash scripts/backup_memory.sh

# Specify env / output directory
bash scripts/backup_memory.sh --env-file .env --output-dir backups
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\backup_memory.ps1
```

> Backup files are written to `backups/` by default. If you are preparing to share the repository or package it for delivery, you usually don't need to include them.

### 4.2 Files Typically Not Needed for Submission

The repository has already placed typical local artifacts into `<repo-root>/.gitignore`:

- Runtime databases: `*.db`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`
- Database lock files: `*.init.lock`, `*.migrate.lock`
- Local tool configurations: `.mcp.json`, `.mcp.json.bak`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.gemini/`, `.agent/`
- Local cache and temporary directories: `.tmp/`, `backend/.pytest_cache/`
- Frontend local artifacts: `frontend/node_modules/`, `frontend/dist/`
- Logs and snapshots: `*.log`, `snapshots/`, `backups/`
- Temporary test drafts: `frontend/src/*.tmp.test.jsx`
- Internal maintenance documents: `docs/improvement/`, `backend/docs/benchmark_*.md`
- One-time comparison summaries: `docs/evaluation_old_vs_new_*.md`
- Local validation reports: `docs/skills/TRIGGER_SMOKE_REPORT.md`, `docs/skills/MCP_LIVE_E2E_REPORT.md`, `docs/skills/CLAUDE_SKILLS_AUDIT.md`

If you are preparing to share the project, package it for delivery, or just want to perform an environment self-check, it is recommended to execute:

```bash
bash scripts/pre_publish_check.sh
```

It checks for common local sensitive artifacts, tool configs, local validation reports, personal paths, and `.env.example` placeholders, helping you quickly confirm if the repository is suitable for direct delivery. If it only finds these local files exist, it will usually give a `WARN` to remind you to confirm them yourself before sharing.

If you additionally run these validation scripts:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_skill.py
cd backend && python ../scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_mcp_e2e.py
```

The scripts will generate summaries in `<repo-root>/docs/skills/TRIGGER_SMOKE_REPORT.md` and `<repo-root>/docs/skills/MCP_LIVE_E2E_REPORT.md` respectively. These two results are mainly for local review and are not the primary instruction documents.
If you just cloned the GitHub repository, it is normal if you don't see these two files yet; they are local artifacts generated after running the scripts.

---

## 5. Initial Validation

> The checks here focus on "getting the system running"; if you need additional local Markdown validation summaries, run the validation scripts mentioned above.

### 5.1 Health Check

```bash
# Local Development
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/health

# Docker Deployment
curl -fsS http://localhost:18000/health
```

Expected return (from the `/health` endpoint in `main.py`):

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-19T08:00:00Z",
  "index": {
    "index_available": true,
    "degraded": false
  },
  "runtime": {
    "write_lanes": { ... },
    "index_worker": { ... }
  }
}
```

> `status` as `"ok"` indicates the system is normal; if the index is unavailable or an error occurs, `status` will become `"degraded"`.

### 5.2 Browsing Memory Tree

```bash
curl -fsS "http://127.0.0.1:8000/browse/node?domain=core&path=" \
  -H "X-MCP-API-Key: <YOUR_MCP_API_KEY>"
```

> This endpoint comes from `api/browse.py`'s `GET /browse/node` and is used to view the memory node tree under a specific domain. The `domain` parameter corresponds to the domains configured in `VALID_DOMAINS` in `.env`.
>
> - If you configured `MCP_API_KEY`, please include the `X-MCP-API-Key` as shown above.
> - If you enabled `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true` and the request comes from the local loopback address (and has no forwarded headers), you can omit the authentication header.

### 5.3 Viewing API Docs

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` in your browser to open the Swagger documentation automatically generated by FastAPI, where you can view all HTTP endpoint parameters and return formats.

## 6. MCP Access

Memory Palace provides **9 tools** via the [MCP protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (defined in `mcp_server.py`):

| Tool Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_memory` | Read memory (supports special URIs like `system://boot`, `system://index`) |
| `create_memory` | Create a new memory node (explicitly filling `title` is recommended) |
| `update_memory` | Update existing memory (priority use of diff patch) |
| `delete_memory` | Delete a memory node |
| `add_alias` | Add an alias for a memory node |
| `search_memory` | Search memory (keyword / semantic / hybrid modes) |
| `compact_context` | Compact context (cleanup old session logs) |
| `rebuild_index` | Rebuild search index |
| `index_status` | View index status |

### 6.1 stdio Mode (Recommended for Local Use)

```bash
cd backend
python mcp_server.py

# If you are starting in a new terminal or client configuration, this one is more stable
./.venv/bin/python mcp_server.py   # Windows PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe mcp_server.py
```

> In `stdio` mode, MCP tools communicate directly through the process's standard input/output, **bypassing the HTTP/SSE authentication layer**. `MCP_API_KEY` is not required.
>
> The `python mcp_server.py` here assumes you are still using the **`backend/.venv` created and populated with dependencies in Step 2**. If you switch to a new terminal or are configuring local MCP in a client, prioritize using the project's own `.venv` interpreter. Otherwise, errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'` will occur before the MCP process truly starts.
>
> If you are accessing MCP in a client configuration, it is highly recommended to use `scripts/run_memory_palace_mcp_stdio.sh` directly. Think of it as the safer default entry: it reuses the current repository `.env` / `DATABASE_URL` first, and only falls back to the repo's default SQLite path when those are missing. That makes client configs less brittle across terminals and machines.

### 6.2 SSE Mode

```bash
cd backend
HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8010 python run_sse.py
```

> The `run_sse.py` process itself uses uvicorn's default `0.0.0.0:8000` listener (customizable via `HOST` and `PORT`), and the SSE endpoint path is `/sse`. But for FastMCP, the effective `HOST` still defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so if you really want remote clients to connect, set `HOST=0.0.0.0` (or your actual bind address) explicitly instead of assuming that "uvicorn is listening" already means "remote clients can connect". SSE mode is still protected by `MCP_API_KEY`.
>
> The same SSE process also provides a lightweight `/health` endpoint, mainly for Docker / scripts to perform readiness checks; the truly open streaming entry point for MCP clients remains `/sse`.
>
> The command above deliberately binds to `127.0.0.1`, which is more suitable for local machine debugging. If you truly need to allow access from other machines, change `HOST` to `0.0.0.0` (or your actual listening address). This will allow remote clients to connect to the listening address, but API Key, reverse proxy, firewall, and transport layer security will still need to be completed by you.
>
> If you use Docker one-click deployment, SSE will be started by an independent container and exposed at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse` via the frontend proxy.
>
> The `HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=8010` example above is for **local loopback**. Only if you indeed want to open it to remote clients should you change it to `HOST=0.0.0.0` (or the target binding address) and complete the network-side security controls yourself.
>
> If you connect to `/sse` once with `curl` or a script, then disconnect and separately send the same `session_id` to `/messages`, seeing a `404` / `410` is normal: it indicates the previous SSE session has closed. The correct normal chain should be "keep the `/sse` connection alive first, and then have the client continue sending requests to `/messages`."

### 6.2.1 Multi-client concurrency (optional, but recommended)

If multiple CLI / IDE hosts will point to the **same SQLite file**, add this block to `.env`:

```env
RUNTIME_WRITE_WAL_ENABLED=true
RUNTIME_WRITE_JOURNAL_MODE=wal
RUNTIME_WRITE_WAL_SYNCHRONOUS=normal
RUNTIME_WRITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS=5000
```

In plain language:

- each stdio MCP client is usually a separate Python process
- different processes do not share the same in-process write lock
- WAL plus a larger `busy_timeout` reduces `database is locked` failures when several clients write at the same time

### 6.3 Client Configuration Examples

**stdio Mode** (applicable to common stdio clients like Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-palace": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["/ABS/PATH/TO/REPO/scripts/run_memory_palace_mcp_stdio.sh"]

> If you haven't created `backend/.venv` yet, go back to **Step 2** to complete the virtual environment and dependency installation.
>
> In a native Windows environment, do not change `command` directly to `python.exe` to execute this `.sh`. A more stable approach is to prepare Git Bash / WSL first and then keep the `bash + run_memory_palace_mcp_stdio.sh` combination; if the current client cannot easily run a shell wrapper, prioritize the scripted installation path in `docs/skills/GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`.

**SSE Mode**:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-palace": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8010/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ Replace `127.0.0.1:8010` here with the actual host and port you used when starting `run_sse.py`.
>
> ⚠️ SSE is still protected by `MCP_API_KEY`. Most clients also need to configure request headers or a Bearer Token; please refer to the client's own MCP documentation for specific field names.
>
> ⚠️ `HOST=0.0.0.0` only means "allow remote connection to this listening address," not "allow unauthenticated access."

## 7. HTTP/SSE Interface Authentication

Some HTTP interfaces of Memory Palace are protected by `MCP_API_KEY`, adopting a **fail-closed** strategy (defaults to `401` if Key is not configured).

### Protected Interfaces

| Route Prefix | Description | Auth Method |
|---|---|---|
| `/maintenance/*` | Maintenance interfaces (orphan node cleanup, etc.) | `require_maintenance_api_key` |
| `/review/*` | Review interfaces (content audit process) | `require_maintenance_api_key` |
| `/browse/*` (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) | Memory tree read/write operations | `require_maintenance_api_key` |
| `/sse` and `/messages` in `run_sse.py` | MCP SSE transport channel and message entry | `apply_mcp_api_key_middleware` |

### Authentication Methods

The backend supports two types of Headers for passing the API Key (defined in `api/maintenance.py` and `run_sse.py`):

```bash
# Method 1: Custom Header
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/maintenance/orphans \
  -H "X-MCP-API-Key: <YOUR_MCP_API_KEY>"

# Method 2: Bearer Token
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8000/maintenance/orphans \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_MCP_API_KEY>"
```

### Frontend Auth Configuration

If the frontend also needs to access protected interfaces, runtime configuration can be injected in **local debugging or your own controlled private deployment environment** (frontend `src/lib/api.js` will read `window.__MEMORY_PALACE_RUNTIME__`):

```html
<script>
  window.__MEMORY_PALACE_RUNTIME__ = {
    maintenanceApiKey: "<YOUR_MCP_API_KEY>",
    maintenanceApiKeyMode: "header"
  };
</script>
```

> Do not write the real `MCP_API_KEY` into any public pages, shared static resources, or HTML delivered to end users. This global object can be read directly in the browser.

> This configuration is mainly for the scenario of **manually starting front and back ends locally**.
>
> Docker one-click deployment by default does not require writing the key into the page: the frontend container will automatically forward the same `MCP_API_KEY` to `/api/*`, `/sse`, and `/messages` at the proxy layer.

### Skipping Auth for Local Debugging

If you don't want to configure an API Key during local development, set the following in `.env`:

```env
MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true
```

> This option only applies to **direct requests** from `127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost`; if the request has forwarded headers, it will still be rejected. It only affects HTTP/SSE interfaces and **does not affect** stdio mode (stdio does not go through the auth layer).

## 8. Common FAQ

| Issue | Cause and Solution |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError` when starting backend | Most common cause is not using `backend/.venv` or not installing dependencies in that environment. Execute `source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt` first; if it's local stdio MCP, prioritize using `./.venv/bin/python mcp_server.py` (Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe mcp_server.py`). |
| `DATABASE_URL` error | Absolute paths are recommended, and it must have the `sqlite+aiosqlite:///` prefix. Example: `sqlite+aiosqlite:////absolute/path/to/memory_palace.db`. |
| Frontend accessing API returns `502` or `Network Error` | Confirm the backend has started and is running on port `8000`. Check if the proxy target in `vite.config.js` matches the backend port. |
| Protected interface returns `401` | Local manual startup: configure `MCP_API_KEY` or set `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true`; Docker: confirm if using the Docker env file generated by `apply_profile.*` / `docker_one_click.*`. |
| Docker startup port conflict | `docker_one_click.sh` automatically finds idle ports by default. You can also specify manually via `--frontend-port` / `--backend-port`. |
