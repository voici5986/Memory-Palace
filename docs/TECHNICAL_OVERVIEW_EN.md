### Core Module Description

- **`main.py`**: FastAPI application entry point, responsible for lifecycle management (database initialization, legacy database file compatibility recovery, and a best-effort drain of pending auto-flush summaries before shutdown), CORS configuration, route registration (`review`, `browse`, `maintenance`, `setup`), and health checks. The current `/health` path returns detailed index / write-lane / index-worker runtime data only for local loopback requests or requests carrying a valid `MCP_API_KEY`; unauthenticated remote probes receive a shallow health payload instead of the full internal status dump. When that detailed health check is already degraded, the endpoint now also returns HTTP `503`, so Docker health checks and operators can treat it as not ready. Default CORS origins are converged to a local common list (`localhost/127.0.0.1` on `5173/3000`); explicitly configured wildcards (`*`) will automatically disable credentials; legacy sqlite recovery will execute regular-file + quick_check + core table existence validation before proceeding, and will strip query/fragment when parsing SQLite URLs, skipping non-file targets like `:memory:` / `file::memory:`.
- **`mcp_server.py`**: Implements 9 MCP tools, including URI parsing (`domain://path` format), snapshot management, write guard decision-making, session caching, and asynchronous index enqueuing logic. It also provides system URI resources (`system://boot`, `system://index`, `system://index-lite`, `system://audit`, `system://recent`). The currently public MCP entry points are `stdio` and SSE: `stdio` connects directly to the tool process; remote access goes through the `/sse + /messages` SSE chain and remains subject to API Key and network-side security controls. `search_memory` now also clamps extreme `candidate_multiplier` expansion back to a hard ceiling and exposes the effective value as `candidate_limit_applied` in metadata; after session-first merging, it also re-sorts the final response by the exposed `score` so the returned order matches the visible ranking field. If a caller only cares about final results, it can also pass `verbose=false` to omit the noisy debug-heavy fields. The final path-state revalidation step now also prefers batched lookups, so larger result sets do not need one SQLite round-trip per row just to confirm the path still exists. When `create_memory` is fail-closed because Write Guard is temporarily unavailable or degraded, the response now also surfaces `retryable` / `retry_hint`, so callers do not have to guess whether the block looks temporary. The `compact_context` / auto-flush summary path now also takes a database-file-backed per-session process lock so two local processes are less likely to write the same session summary twice.
- **`runtime_state.py`**: Manages the write lane (serialized write operations), index worker (asynchronous queue processing for index rebuilding tasks), vitality decay scheduling, cleanup review approval process, and sleep consolidation scheduling. The current session-first retrieval cache and flush tracker both apply in-process bounds with **per-session caps plus a total session limit**, so long-running services do not grow without bound just because many distinct sessions have touched the process; the session-first hit cache also lazily prunes stale entries so old hits do not keep occupying capacity forever.
- **`run_sse.py`**: SSE transport layer, responsible for API Key authentication and session management for the `/sse` and `/messages` links. The current implementation clears sessions upon client disconnection; if you continue to send requests to `/messages` using an old `session_id`, the server will explicitly return `404/410` instead of pretending `202 Accepted`. On trusted proxy paths it now prefers `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` when building the `/messages` burst-limit key, and it sends heartbeat pings every 15 seconds by default. Transport-security host/origin checks now keep the normal loopback allowlist by default; if you really need remote hostnames or origins to pass those checks, add them explicitly through `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` / `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` instead of relying on a non-loopback bind to open everything. The repository now keeps two usage modes: standalone local debugging can still run `run_sse.py` directly, while the default Docker path mounts the same SSE entrypoints into the `main.py` backend process and exposes them through the frontend proxy.
- **`db/sqlite_client.py`**: SQLite database operation layer, containing memory CRUD, keyword/semantic/hybrid retrieval modes, write_guard logic (supports three-level determination: semantic matching + keyword matching + LLM decision), gist generation and caching, vitality scoring and decay, embedding retrieval (supports remote API and local hash modes), and reranker integration. Database initialization now uses `.init.lock` based on the database file path for process-level serialization, preventing `backend` / `sse` from competing for the database during initial concurrent startup; non-file targets like `:memory:` will not generate this lock.
- **`db/migration_runner.py`**: Discovers and applies SQL migrations while tracking versions and checksums. The checksum normalization now handles both `CRLF/LF` differences and UTF-8 BOM, so a migration file that only changed because of a Windows/Notepad-style file header does not look like schema drift.

---

## 3. HTTP API Endpoints

In plain English:

- `/browse`: The most commonly used, responsible for **viewing and writing memories**.
- `/review`: Used when changes need to be reviewed, responsible for **viewing diffs, rolling back, and confirming integration**.
- `/maintenance`: System O&M entry point, responsible for **cleanup, rebuilding indices, and viewing runtime status**.

If you are just connecting a regular client, usually looking at `/browse` and `/review` is enough.

### Browsing and Writing (`/browse`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/browse/node` | API Key | Browse memory tree (including child nodes, breadcrumbs, gist, aliases) |
| `POST` | `/browse/node` | API Key | Create memory node (includes write_guard) |
| `PUT` | `/browse/node` | API Key | Update memory node (includes write_guard) |
| `DELETE` | `/browse/node` | API Key | Delete memory path |

This is the most "business-like" group of interfaces:

- Memory tree browsing
- Create / Update / Delete memories
- Returns results including the current node, child nodes, breadcrumbs, gist, and other data for direct frontend use
- The write endpoints in this group now also create Review snapshots first; in Review, the visible session name carries the current database scope (for example `dashboard-<scope>`) so different SQLite targets do not get mixed together
- `POST / PUT /browse/node` also applies a default content-length check (`BROWSE_CONTENT_MAX_CHARS`, default 1 MiB) so accidental huge bodies do not go straight through the Dashboard write path
- `POST /browse/node` also validates the resulting path length (`BROWSE_PATH_MAX_CHARS`, default 512) before writing; if `parent_path + title` is too long, the API returns `422` immediately instead of letting the write proceed
- If the write lane cannot hand out a write slot in time, the `browse` / `review` / `maintenance` write endpoints now return a structured `503` (`write_lane_timeout`) instead of a generic `500`; the MCP write tools return the same condition as a retryable structured error payload

### Review and Rollback (`/review`)

Route-level API Key authentication (all endpoints require authentication).

One implementation boundary to keep in mind:

- snapshot files still live under the repo-level `snapshots/` directory;
- however, session listing, snapshot listing, and snapshot reads are filtered by the **current database scope**, so changing `DATABASE_URL`, switching to another temporary SQLite file, or pointing Docker at another data volume does not mix rollback sessions from a different database into the current Review queue;
- within the same `session_id`, snapshot writes are serialized, and both `manifest.json` and per-resource snapshot JSON files are written through atomic replace; this keeps same-session Review metadata much less likely to lose entries or expose half-written JSON when multiple local processes share the same checkout;
- if `manifest.json` is damaged, the backend now tries to rebuild it under the original session scope first; it only persists the rebuilt manifest when that original scope can still be trusted. If the scope cannot be recovered safely, the session stays hidden and is not auto-deleted by a read-only session listing;
- legacy snapshot sessions that were created before scope metadata existed are hidden by default instead of being exposed under the wrong database context.
- if the same URI already has a later **content snapshot** in another Review session, rolling back the older snapshot now returns `409` instead of silently undoing the newer content change.
- for `create` rollbacks with many descendants, the current implementation now batches descendant path deletion, orphan cleanup, and current-node deletion inside one write-lane execution, reducing repeated lane round-trips on large trees.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/review/sessions` | List review sessions |
| `GET` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}/snapshots` | View list of session snapshots |
| `GET` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}/snapshots/{resource_id}` | View snapshot details |
| `GET` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}/diff/{resource_id}` | View version diff |
| `POST` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}/rollback/{resource_id}` | Execute rollback |
| `DELETE` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}/snapshots/{resource_id}` | Confirm integration (delete snapshot) |
| `DELETE` | `/review/sessions/{session_id}` | Clear snapshots for the entire session |
| `GET` | `/review/deprecated` | List all deprecated memories |
| `DELETE` | `/review/memories/{memory_id}` | Permanently delete reviewed memory |
| `POST` | `/review/diff` | Universal text diff calculation |

This group of interfaces is more like a "change review area":

- Check session first
- Then check snapshot / diff
- Finally decide whether to rollback or integrate

### Maintenance and Observability (`/maintenance`)

Route-level API Key authentication (all endpoints require authentication).

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/maintenance/orphans` | View orphaned memories (deprecated or no path pointing to them) |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/orphans/{memory_id}` | View orphaned memory details |
| `DELETE` | `/maintenance/orphans/{memory_id}` | Permanently delete orphaned memory (if a deprecated final target is still referenced by older versions, deletion is rejected until the older chain is cleaned first) |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/import/prepare` | Prepare external import task (generates executable plan) |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/import/execute` | Execute external import task |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/import/jobs/{job_id}` | View import task status |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/import/jobs/{job_id}/rollback` | Rollback import task |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/learn/trigger` | Trigger explicit learning task |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/learn/jobs/{job_id}` | View explicit learning task status |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/learn/jobs/{job_id}/rollback` | Rollback explicit learning task |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/vitality/decay` | Trigger vitality decay |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/vitality/candidates/query` | Query cleanup candidate memories (supports `domain` / `path_prefix` filtering) |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/vitality/cleanup/prepare` | Prepare cleanup approval (generates review_id + token) |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/vitality/cleanup/confirm` | Confirm and execute cleanup (requires review_id + token + confirmation phrase) |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/index/worker` | View index worker status |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/index/job/{job_id}` | View index task details |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/index/job/{job_id}/cancel` | Cancel index task |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/index/job/{job_id}/retry` | Retry index task |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/index/rebuild` | Trigger full index rebuild |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/index/reindex/{memory_id}` | Reindex single item |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/index/sleep-consolidation` | Trigger sleep consolidation |
| `POST` | `/maintenance/observability/search` | Observability search (including retrieval statistics) |
| `GET` | `/maintenance/observability/summary` | Observability overview |

This group of interfaces is large but can be categorized into 5 types:

1. **Import / Learning Tasks**: `import/*`, `learn/*`
2. **Orphaned Memory Cleanup**: `orphans*`
3. **Vitality Governance**: `vitality/*`
4. **Index Tasks**: `index/*`
5. **Runtime Observability**: `observability/*`

Full API documentation can be accessed via Swagger UI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` after starting the backend.

## 4. MCP Tool Implementation

Implementation file: `backend/mcp_server.py`

| Tool | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `read_memory` | Read | Read memory content, supports full text and segments (chunk_id / range / max_chars), supports system URIs (`system://boot`, `system://index`, `system://index-lite`, `system://audit`, `system://recent`) |
| `create_memory` | Write | Create new memory node (includes write_guard, enters write lane for serialization; recommended to fill `title` explicitly) |
| `update_memory` | Write | Update existing memory (prefers `old_string/new_string` for precise replacement; `append` is only for true tail appending, includes write_guard) |
| `delete_memory` | Write | Delete memory path (enters write lane for serialization) |
| `add_alias` | Write | Add alias path for the same memory (can cross domains) |
| `search_memory` | Retrieval | Unified retrieval entry point (keyword/semantic/hybrid), supports intent classification and strategy templates |
| `compact_context` | Governance | Compress current session context into long-term memory summary (enters write lane for serialization) |
| `rebuild_index` | Maintenance | Full or single index rebuild, supports synchronous waiting and sleep consolidation |
| `index_status` | Maintenance | Query index availability, runtime status, and configuration switches |

### Dashboard's Four Functional Modules

| Module | Route | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Memory Browser | `/memory` | Browse tree by domain, inline editing, view gist summaries, alias management |
| Review | `/review` | View write snapshot diffs, support rollback and integrate confirmation, clean up deprecated memories |
| Maintenance | `/maintenance` | View vitality scores, clean up orphaned memories, trigger index rebuilds, manage cleanup approval process, support `domain` / `path_prefix` filtering |
| Observability | `/observability` | Retrieval logs and statistics, task execution records, index worker status, system status overview, support `scope_hint` and more granular runtime snapshots |

Additional notes:

- The current frontend restores the stored language first; if there is no stored choice yet, common Chinese browser locales (`zh`, `zh-TW`, `zh-HK`, and similar `zh-*`) are normalized to `zh-CN`, and other first-visit cases fall back to English. The application shell still provides a language switch entry and a unified authentication entry in the upper right corner.
- Language switching supports one-click switching between English and Chinese, results will be saved in the browser's `localStorage` as `memory-palace.locale`.
- Common static copy, date/number formats, and common frontend-side error mappings will follow the current language switch.
- If authentication is not yet configured, the page shell will still open, but protected data requests will show an authorization prompt, empty state, or `401`.
- When starting via the recommended one-click Docker path, protected requests usually already work: the frontend proxy automatically forwards the same `MCP_API_KEY` on the server side; however, the page may still keep showing `Set API key`, because the browser page itself does not know the proxy-held key. Only when protected data also starts failing with `401` or empty states should you keep troubleshooting env / proxy configuration.
- Stored browser Dashboard auth now lives in the current browser session's `sessionStorage`; if a legacy `localStorage` value is found, the frontend only migrates it forward once and clears the old copy.

---

## 6. Frontend Authentication Injection Model

The frontend does not read maintenance keys from `VITE_*` build variables; it uses runtime injection:

```html
<script>
  window.__MEMORY_PALACE_RUNTIME__ = {
    maintenanceApiKey: "<YOUR_MCP_API_KEY>",
    maintenanceApiKeyMode: "header"
  };
</script>
```

`maintenanceApiKeyMode` supports: `header` (sends `X-MCP-API-Key` header) or `bearer` (sends `Authorization: Bearer` header).

> Compatibility: The runtime object is also compatible with the old field name `window.__MCP_RUNTIME_CONFIG__`.
>
> Code reference: `readWindowRuntimeMaintenanceAuth()` and `getMaintenanceAuthState()` in `frontend/src/lib/api.js`.
>
> In plain language: the frontend first trusts a runtime-injected key; if that is missing, it falls back to a key saved in the current browser session. A legacy Dashboard key left in `localStorage` is only migrated once and then removed from the old location.
>
> In plain English: the frontend makes authentication "runtime-decided," so you can either fill in the key directly at the top of the page or have it injected by a deployment script before the page loads.
>
> The extra value of `run_memory_palace_mcp_stdio.sh` is not that `mcp_server.py` would otherwise "randomly pick the wrong database" by itself. Its value is that it gives CLI/client configs a safer default entry: prefer the repository `.env` / `DATABASE_URL`; if `.env` already sets `RETRIEVAL_REMOTE_TIMEOUT_SEC`, it also keeps using that value; only when the checkout has neither a local `.env` nor an `.env.docker` file does it fall back to the repo's default SQLite path. If `.env.docker` exists without `.env`, the wrapper now refuses that `demo.db` fallback explicitly so local stdio traffic does not get mixed up with Docker container data; if `.env` or an explicit `DATABASE_URL` still points to `/app/...` or `/data/...`, it also refuses to start.

> Docker one-click deployment uses a third way: it doesn't inject the key into the page but automatically forwards it at the frontend proxy layer.

## 7. Data and Task Flow

### Write Path

1. `create_memory` / `update_memory` enters the **write lane** (serialized write operations; transient SQLite lock conflicts get a small bounded retry first).
2. Executes **write_guard** determination before writing (core decisions: `ADD` / `UPDATE` / `NOOP` / `DELETE`; `BYPASS` is a process marker for upper-layer metadata-only updates).
   - write_guard supports a three-level determination chain: semantic matching → keyword matching → LLM decision (optional).
3. Generates **snapshot** and version changes (recorded separately by `path` and `memory` dimensions; both MCP writes and Dashboard `/browse/node` writes follow the same semantics; same-session snapshot writes are now serialized through a file lock).
4. Enqueues **index task** (returns `index_dropped` / `queue_full` if queue is full; DB-writing index jobs now also pass through the same write lane instead of racing the foreground write path).

### Retrieval Path

1. **`preprocess_query`** preprocesses the query text (standardizes whitespace, tokenizes, preserves multilingual/URI).
2. **`classify_intent`** routes by default based on 4 core intents; defaults to `factual` (template `factual_high_precision`) when no significant keyword signals are present, and falls back to `unknown` (template `default`) when signals conflict or are mixed with low signals:
   - `factual` → Strategy template `factual_high_precision` (High-precision matching)
   - `exploratory` → Strategy template `exploratory_high_recall` (High-recall exploration)
   - `temporal` → Strategy template `temporal_time_filtered` (Time-filtered)
   - `causal` → Strategy template `causal_wide_pool` (Causal reasoning, wide candidate pool)
   - `unknown` → Strategy template `default` (Conservative fallback when signals conflict or are mixed)
3. Executes **keyword / semantic / hybrid** retrieval.
4. Optional **reranker** re-ranking (via remote API call).
5. Supports additional query-side constraints, such as `scope_hint`, `domain`, `path_prefix`, `max_priority`.
6. Returns `results` and `degrade_reasons`.

> Vector-dimension checks now follow the scope that the current query actually targets instead of doing a global full-table decision first. In practice, old vectors in an unrelated domain no longer force a false semantic fallback; if the vectors inside the current scope really mismatch, `degrade_reasons` now tells the caller that a reindex is required.

> Intent classification is implemented using the `keyword_scoring_v2` method (`db/sqlite_client.py` `classify_intent` method), inferring intent through keyword matching scores and rankings without external model calls.
>
> **Configuration Strategy Notes**:
> - This project supports two approaches: `1)` directly configuring embedding / reranker / llm separately; `2)` unifying these capabilities via a `router` proxy.
> - `INTENT_LLM_ENABLED` is disabled by default; when enabled, it will first attempt LLM intent classification and fall back to existing keyword rules if it fails.
> - `RETRIEVAL_MMR_ENABLED` is disabled by default; deduplication / diversity re-ranking only occurs under `hybrid` retrieval.
> - `RETRIEVAL_SQLITE_VEC_ENABLED` is disabled by default; the legacy vector path remains the default implementation, with sqlite-vec undergoing controlled rollout.
> - For local development, the former is generally recommended because failures in the three links are usually independent, making it easier to confirm which model, endpoint, or set of keys has an issue.
> - `router` is more suitable as a unified entry point for production/client environments: convenient for centralized authentication, rate limiting, auditing, model switching, and fallback orchestration.

## 8. Deployment Specifications

| Scenario | Host Port | Internal Container Port | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local Development | Backend `8000` · Frontend `5173` | — | Direct startup |
| Docker Default | Backend `18000` · Frontend `3000` · SSE `3000/sse` | Backend `8000` (serves both REST + SSE) · Frontend `8080` | Ports can be overridden via env vars |

Docker port environment variables:

- Backend: `MEMORY_PALACE_BACKEND_PORT` (falls back to `NOCTURNE_BACKEND_PORT`, default `18000`)
- Frontend: `MEMORY_PALACE_FRONTEND_PORT` (falls back to `NOCTURNE_FRONTEND_PORT`, default `3000`)

One more thing:

- Changing the SSE listening address to `0.0.0.0` (or another non-loopback address) only means remote clients can connect to this listening address; it does not mean `MCP_API_KEY`, reverse proxies, firewalls, or TLS security controls can be bypassed.

Related files:

- Compose file: `docker-compose.yml`
- Image definition: `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.backend` (based on `python:3.11-slim`), `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.frontend` (build stage `node:22-alpine`, run stage `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.27-alpine`)
- Backend healthcheck helper: `deploy/docker/backend-healthcheck.py` (performs a second check against `/health` inside the container and requires the payload to report `status == "ok"`)
- Nginx configuration template: `deploy/docker/nginx.conf.template` (server-side forwarding for `X-MCP-API-Key`, plus `no-store/no-cache/must-revalidate` on `/index.html` to reduce stale entry pages after frontend updates; the frontend entrypoint escapes special characters in the proxy-held key, rejects the remaining ASCII control characters, and then generates the final Nginx config)
- Entrypoint scripts: `deploy/docker/backend-entrypoint.sh`, `deploy/docker/frontend-entrypoint.sh`
- Backup scripts: `scripts/backup_memory.sh`, `scripts/backup_memory.ps1` (keep the latest `20` backups by default; adjust with `--keep` / `-Keep`; backup filenames use UTC timestamps so host/container runs sort consistently)
- Pre-publishing check: `scripts/pre_publish_check.sh`

## 9. Security Defaults

- All `/maintenance/*` and `/review/*` endpoints require API Key authentication.
- All `/browse` read/write operations (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) are gated via endpoint-level `Depends(require_maintenance_api_key)`.
- Public HTTP endpoints include `/`, `/health`, and FastAPI's default documentation endpoints; `/health` stays public only for a shallow payload, while detailed runtime/index data is reserved for local loopback or authenticated requests. All other Browse / Review / Maintenance and SSE channels follow the same authentication logic.
- Defaults to **fail-closed** (rejects requests) if `MCP_API_KEY` is empty.
- Access is only allowed locally without a key if `MCP_API_KEY_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCAL=true` **and** the request is loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `::1` / `localhost`), and only for direct loopback requests without forwarding headers.
- Docker containers run as non-root users by default:
  - Backend: Custom user `app` (UID `10001`, GID `10001`)
  - Frontend: Uses official `nginx-unprivileged` non-root image
