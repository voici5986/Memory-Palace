# Memory Palace Skills Docs

This directory describes the skills / MCP orchestration setup for Memory Palace.

One boundary first:

- If you only started `Dashboard / API / SSE` through `docker compose` or GHCR images, this is not always your first stop.
- Keep reading only when you also want to wire `Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / IDE hosts` into this repository.
- Docker starts the service side; it does not automatically rewrite local skill / MCP / IDE host configuration on your machine.
- If you want the AI to guide installation step by step, start with the standalone repo [`memory-palace-setup`](https://github.com/AGI-is-going-to-arrive/memory-palace-setup); the current stance is **skills + MCP first, not MCP-only first**.
- If you do not want the repo-local install path and only want to **connect a client manually to the Docker-exposed `/sse` endpoint**, start with:
  - `docs/GHCR_QUICKSTART_EN.md`
  - `6.2 SSE mode` and `6.3 client configuration examples` in `docs/GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`

If this is your first time looking here, it is recommended to read in this order:

1. **Start with the shortest path**
   - `memory-palace-setup` repo
   - `SKILLS_QUICKSTART_EN.md`
2. **Use the step-by-step path only when you need setup checks or troubleshooting**
   - `GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`
3. **Then read the full design**
   - `MEMORY_PALACE_SKILLS_EN.md`
4. **If you are integrating an IDE host**
   - `IDE_HOSTS_EN.md`

## What these files are each for

- If you only want to know “which command should I run now,” start with `SKILLS_QUICKSTART_EN.md`
- If you want the AI to do the routing instead of reading the whole setup stack yourself, install `memory-palace-setup` first, then say: `Use $memory-palace-setup to install and configure Memory Palace step by step. Prefer skills + MCP.`
- If you are already wiring it and need to check “was the skill discovered” or “is MCP really bound to this checkout,” then read `GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`
- `GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`
  - For people connecting it for the first time
  - Mainly answers “how to wire it step by step, and how to verify each step”
- `SKILLS_QUICKSTART_EN.md`
  - For people who want the shortest path first
  - Mainly answers “what to run first, which clients are wired in what way right now, and which boundaries matter up front”
- `MEMORY_PALACE_SKILLS_EN.md`
  - For people who want to see the full design
  - Mainly explains the canonical bundle, variants, and workflow boundaries
- `CLI_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE_EN.md`
  - For multi-CLI integration scenarios
  - Mainly focuses on the differences among Claude / Gemini / Codex / OpenCode
- `IDE_HOSTS_EN.md`
  - For IDE-like hosts such as Cursor / Windsurf / VSCode-host / Antigravity
  - Focuses on the `AGENTS.md + MCP snippet` projection path instead of hidden skill mirrors

## Local validation reports

- `TRIGGER_SMOKE_REPORT.md`
  - Generated after running `python scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_skill.py`
- `MCP_LIVE_E2E_REPORT.md`
  - Generated after running `cd backend && python ../scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_mcp_e2e.py`

They are mainly used to help you re-check the connection results in the current environment, and they are not the primary entry documents.
If you do not temporarily see these two files in a freshly cloned GitHub repository, that is normal; run the commands above first and then check again.
If you plan to forward them to someone else, read through the contents yourself first; this kind of local report may include paths on your machine or traces of client configuration.
If you do not want to overwrite the default files during parallel review or CI, set `MEMORY_PALACE_SKILL_REPORT_PATH` / `MEMORY_PALACE_MCP_E2E_REPORT_PATH` first. When you use relative paths, the scripts now redirect them under the system temp directory's `memory-palace-reports/` root; if you want a fully controlled destination, prefer absolute paths outside the repository.

## Where is the canonical bundle

The real canonical bundle is here:

- `docs/skills/memory-palace/`

What is inside:

- `SKILL.md`
- `references/`
- `variants/`
- `agents/openai.yaml`

A one-sentence way to understand it:

> The public documents are responsible for telling users how to use it, while the canonical bundle is responsible for defining what this skill actually is.

One more repository-level note:

> `Memory-Palace/AGENTS.md` is now shipped as a repo-local rule entry as well, so clients such as Antigravity that support `AGENTS.md` can read the repository constraints directly. Older setups can still fall back to the legacy `GEMINI.md` convention.

One more unified repository stance:

> IDE hosts such as `Cursor / Windsurf / VSCode-host / Antigravity` should no longer treat hidden skill mirrors as the default integration path. They should consume the repository through `AGENTS.md + python scripts/render_ide_host_config.py ...`, which projects the same skills + MCP capability surface into IDE hosts.
