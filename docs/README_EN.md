# Memory Palace Documentation Center

> **Memory Palace** is a long-term memory system designed for AI coding assistants. Through MCP (Model Context Protocol), it provides a unified path for memory read/write, retrieval, review, and maintenance for Codex / Claude Code / Gemini CLI / OpenCode; for IDE hosts such as `Cursor / Windsurf / VSCode-host / Antigravity`, it is recommended to start with `docs/skills/IDE_HOSTS_EN.md`.

> This section prioritizes the instructions that **users will actually need**.
>
> If you want the AI to walk you through installation, start with the standalone repo [`memory-palace-setup`](https://github.com/AGI-is-going-to-arrive/memory-palace-setup). The repository stance is: **prefer skills + MCP first, not MCP-only by default**.
>
> If you need additional verification of skill smoke tests or the real MCP call chain, you can run `python scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_skill.py` or `cd backend && python ../scripts/evaluate_memory_palace_mcp_e2e.py`. They generate local summaries under `docs/skills/`, but those reports are not the primary entry documents. The current scripts also redact common secret-like values, local absolute paths, and session tokens in those reports, and use private file permissions where the host supports them. `evaluate_memory_palace_skill.py` now returns a non-zero exit code whenever any check is `FAIL`; `SKIP` / `PARTIAL` / `MANUAL` do not fail the process by themselves. If `codex exec` does not emit structured output before the smoke timeout, the `codex` item is reported as `PARTIAL` instead of blocking the whole run. In this round, `evaluate_memory_palace_mcp_e2e.py` also gained a re-exec guard so a local Python handoff does not re-enter repeatedly by accident.
>
> Also, A/B/C/D are better understood as different configuration profiles, not a seamless hot-switch button. Once you change embedding backend / model / dimension, be ready to re-check whether the existing index still matches; when the runtime detects a dimension mismatch, it asks for reindex instead of pretending the profile switch already succeeded.
>
> The frontend currently defaults to English; the language button in the upper-right corner lets you switch between English and Chinese with one click, and the browser will remember your choice. If a stored language already exists, the current frontend now applies that choice to `document.lang` and the page title before React mounts.

> Current docs in this English set reflect the 2026-04-18 verified behavior for Review rollback safety, fail-closed search revalidation, side-effect-free setup status probing, and the latest Dashboard language/setup interaction details.

## 🔧 Core Documents

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW_EN.md](TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW_EN.md) | Overview of the implementation structure and tech stack for the backend, frontend, MCP, and Docker |

| [skills/SKILLS_QUICKSTART_EN.md](skills/SKILLS_QUICKSTART_EN.md) | Understand in one page how the CLI-client skill path is triggered, how MCP is configured, and how acceptance is verified |
| [changelog/release_v3.7.1_2026-03-26_EN.md](changelog/release_v3.7.1_2026-03-26_EN.md) | Actual fixes, verification scope, and conservative boundaries for `v3.7.1` |

## 🧩 Skills and Clients

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [skills/MEMORY_PALACE_SKILLS_EN.md](skills/MEMORY_PALACE_SKILLS_EN.md) | Canonical `memory-palace` skill design, installation, and multi-CLI orchestration strategy |
| [skills/CLI_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE_EN.md](skills/CLI_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE_EN.md) | Recommended installation paths, verification methods, and known boundaries for each CLI |
| [skills/IDE_HOSTS_EN.md](skills/IDE_HOSTS_EN.md) | How IDE hosts such as Cursor / Windsurf / VSCode-host / Antigravity should connect to this repository |

> If you only want to get the service running first, start with the **GHCR prebuilt image** path in `GETTING_STARTED_EN.md`.
>
> If you also want to wire `Claude / Codex / Gemini / OpenCode / IDE hosts` into this repository, continue with the docs under `docs/skills/`. Docker starts the service side; it does not automatically rewrite the local skill / MCP configuration on your machine.

## 📊 Evaluation and Quality

| Document | Description |
|---|---|
| [EVALUATION_EN.md](EVALUATION_EN.md) | Public benchmark methodology, summary of key A/B/C/D metrics, and reproduction commands |

> Verification note for this session: backend reruns were `1017 passed / 22 skipped`; frontend reruns were `173 passed`; frontend `typecheck`, build, `bash scripts/pre_publish_check.sh`, and `docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml config` all passed. This same session also reran a repo-local macOS `Profile B` real-browser smoke and a local C/D retrieval + reranker + LLM smoke behind an explicit private-target allowlist. Repo-local live MCP e2e, Docker one-click `Profile C/D`, native Windows, and native Linux host runtime paths were not rerun in this round and still keep explicit target-environment recheck boundaries.
